## My process

- First design HTML markup, I identify  three parts in the card, the the cover background, the profile picture, and the information.
- Check if any alement change in size when displayed in larger devices and start defining media queries.
- Set all custom properties for colors, sizes, weigths and all that.
- Start adding styles using BEM from the outter element to the inner parts of the card.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Position elements in layouts
- Set several graphics as background images
- Use of BEM for CSS arquitecture
- Media Query to reposition bg images


### Continued development

- I would love to refine the application of BEM in future projects, and try different approaches to design reusable and mantainable CSS, and apply all of this with a preprocessor to agilize development.

### Useful resources
